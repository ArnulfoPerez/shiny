## Developing Data Products Coursera Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

Repository of a Shiny App that gives statistics of Covid-19 in MÃ©xico.
The code is based and inspired on the work of [Diego Valle](https://www.diegovalle.net/) that you can browse in his [github repository](https://github.com/diegovalle). Specifically the [R package mxmaps](https://github.com/diegovalle/mxmaps) and [mapa_covid.R](https://gist.github.com/diegovalle/9e72ecc855f720aa645e33494d6efcb8)
 
 The data source for the application is [open data about covid-19 from the mexican government](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico). You can download the dataset [here](http://187.191.75.115/gobmx/salud/datos_abiertos/datos_abiertos_covid19.zip).
