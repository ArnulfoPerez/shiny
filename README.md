## Developing Data Products Coursera Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

A Shiny App that gives statistics of Covid-19 in MÃ©xico. 

The source is available in a [github repository](https://github.com/ArnulfoPerez/shiny).

The documentation is [here](https://arnulfoperez.github.io/shiny/).

The live app is [here](https://zintegra.shinyapps.io/shiny/).

The code is based and inspired on the work of [Diego Valle](https://www.diegovalle.net/) that you can browse in his [github repository](https://github.com/diegovalle). Specifically the [R package mxmaps](https://github.com/diegovalle/mxmaps) and [mapa_covid.R](https://gist.github.com/diegovalle/9e72ecc855f720aa645e33494d6efcb8)
 
 The data source for the application is [open data about covid-19 from the mexican government](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico). You can download the dataset [here](http://187.191.75.115/gobmx/salud/datos_abiertos/datos_abiertos_covid19.zip). The metadata is available [here](https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-152127): The data dictionary [here](http://187.191.75.115/gobmx/salud/datos_abiertos/diccionario_datos_covid19.zip), and historical data [here](https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-bases-historicas-direccion-general-de-epidemiologia).
 
 For worldwide data on Covid-19, you can check [The Open COVID-19 Dataset repository](https://github.com/open-covid-19/data) that contains datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19, including state/province epidemiology data for over 30 countries and county/municipality data for US, UK, NL and CO. A simple visualization tool was built to explore the Open COVID-19 datasets, the [Open COVID-19 Explorer](https://open-covid-19.github.io/explorer).
